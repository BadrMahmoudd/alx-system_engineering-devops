       When no arguments are given, the results are unspecified. If a variable assignment  pre‚Äê
       cedes  the  command name of export but that variable is not also listed as an operand of
       export, then that variable shall be set in the current shell execution environment after
       the  completion  of  the  export command, but it is unspecified whether that variable is
       marked for export.
